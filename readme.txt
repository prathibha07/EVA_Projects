Let's start some coding:

• Linux and Max users, please open your terminal. On Mac, the easiest way to open it is to press anywhere cmd + space, and then in the Spotlight Search you enter "terminal". On Linux, you will find it very easily, usually on the left side of your monitor. Then inside the terminal, copy paste and enter each of the following line commands separately:

• conda install pytorch==0.3.1 -c pytorch

• conda install -c conda-forge kivy


• And Windows users, please open the anaconda prompt, which you can find this way: Windows Button in the lower left corner -> List of programs -> anaconda -> anaconda prompt Then inside the anaconda prompt, copy paste and enter each of the following line commands separately:

• conda install -c peterjc123 pytorch-cpu

• conda install -c conda-forge kivy
