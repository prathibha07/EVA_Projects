Yolo (v3) in action - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58GonmMMU8A

Training an object detection model using a normal PC and an internet browser. Yes! It is possible. 
Google Colab lets us install Nvidia CUDA inside the Colab runtime and takes only a couple of hours to train Tiny YoloV3 on my manually annotated images of the dog (~200-250) 
In certain instances, it sometimes fails to detect the object from certain viewpoints. 
Detection can be made more accurate by increasing the annotated images of the dogs and incorporating data augmentation techniques.
