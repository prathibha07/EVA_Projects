MNIST dataset with Pytorch

    Total params: 14,744
    -with dropout of 0.1 
    -with batchnorm
    -with StepLR with step size = 6 and gamma = 0.1
    - no of epochs- less than 15
    
    Accuracy acheived 
    1) with bn , no rotate, with step lr - 99.2%
    2) with bn no step,no rotate - 99.13%
    3) with bn , rotate, no step 99.08%
    4) without bn no step no rotate - 99%
    5) with bn and rotate and step lr- accuracy falls- need to try for less degree of rotation
